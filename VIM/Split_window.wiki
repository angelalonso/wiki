====== Split window ======
Created Thursday 26 May 2016

===== Open two files in two, vertically splitted, windows =====
vim -O file1 file2



===== Recommended: Shortcut to split vertically and focus on the new one with \w =====
on .vimrc:

nnoremap <leader>w <C-w>v<C-w>l

===== Recommended: Shortcuts to move between windows with <CTRL> + [ h | j | k | l ] =====
nnoremap <C-h> <C-W>h
nnoremap <C-l> <C-W>l
nnoremap <C-j> <C-W>j
nnoremap <C-k> <C-W>k

Originally it had a <C-W>_ at the end, as in:
nnoremap <C-h> <C-W>h<C-W>_
, but it does not seem to be needed
