Data
  
== Transport Layer == 
=== TCP ===

0-16      Source port, 16 bits (0-65535)
17-32     Destination port, 16 bits (0-65535)
33-64     Sequence number, 32 bits, number of bytes sent
65-96     Acknowledgment number, 32 bits, number of bytes received
97-104    Header length, 8 bits = 40 unless options are used
105-106   Unused, 2 bits
107       URG, 1 bit, unused
108       ACK, 1 bit, 1 = received sequence through acknowledgment number
109       PSH, 1 bit, unused
110       RST, 1 bit
111       SYN, 1 bit, 1 = opening connection
112       FIN, 1 bit, 1 = closing connection
113-128   Receiver window size, 16 bits (bytes free in buffer, scaled using option in setup)
129-144   Checksum, 16 bits (XOR of header only)
145-160   Urgent pointer, 16 bits, unused

Options, variable length (usually 0)

Data, variable length (usually 0-1500) 

==== TCP Connection setup ====
Protocol to open and close connections.

  Action             Client state        Server state
  ------             ------------        ------------
                     CLOSED              LISTEN
  SYN --->           SYN_SENT            SYN_RCVD
  <--- SYN+ACK       ESTABLISHED         ESTABLISHED
                     ...                 ...
  FIN --->           FIN_WAIT_1          CLOSE_WAIT
  <--- ACK           FIN_WAIT_2
  <--- FIN           TIME_WAIT           LAST_ACK
  ACK --->                               CLOSED
  Wait 30 seconds    CLOSED

==== TCP Flow control ====
Protocol to ensure that the sender does not send data faster than the receiver can receive it.

    Receiver sends window size in ACK
    If window is small, sender waits
    If window size is 0, sender sends 1 byte (to get updated window in ACK) 

==== TCP Congestion control ====
Protocol to ensure that the sender does not send data faster than the network can transmit it.

    Tahoe
        Send 1 pack, wait for ACK (slow start)
        Send 2, 4, 8, ... up to threshold, wait for ACK
        If timeout, divide threshold by 2 and go back to 1, 2, 4, 8... 
    Reno (most commonly used)
        Fast retransmission after 3 ACKs
        Fast recovery, cancel slow start after 3 ACKs 
    Vegas
        Uses round trip delays to predict congestion 

=== UDP ===

0-16   Source port, 16 bits (0-65535)
17-32  Destination port, 16 bits (0-65535)
33-48  Length in bytes, 16 bits (0-65535)
49-64  Checksum, XOR of header, 16 bits 

If the header checksum fails, the packet is discarded. The data is not error checked.
