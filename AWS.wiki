Public, Private and Hybrid cloud
Infrastructure as a service, Platform as a service, Software as a service
(TODO: WHAT???)


== AZ, Region, Edge Location ==
AZ
- Logical Datacenter in a region
- Each AZ has separate power, network, connectivity
- An AZ can be several Datacenters, if they are close they count as one AZ
- e.g.: us-east-1a
Region
- Framework in which we have all the available providers
  - e.g.: for EC2, Storage, DBs...we need a region to build our services into
- Geographical location with collection of AZs mapped to physical Datacenters on given region
- e.g.: us-east-1
Edge Location
- Locations where end user services are provided
- Endpoints for AWS used for caching content
- way more than regions (150 currently)

== Autoscaling ==
Allows provisioning and launching new instances whenever there is a demand
Allows to automatically increase or decrease resource capacity in relation to the demand
Monitors applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady predictable performance at lowest possible cost
=== How to add existing instance to new ASG ===
EC2 console
Select instance
Actions -> Instance settings -> Attach to Autoscaling Group
Select new ASG
Attach it to the instance
Edit instance if needed

== VPC ==
Virtual Private Cloud
Resource placement + connectivity + Security
You can add EC2 and RDS as needed
You can also define communication to other VPCs, regions, AZs
=== VPC not resolving server through DNS... ===
You need to enable DNS hostname resolution
=== Security products and features in VPC ===
Security Groups - Act as firewall for the EC2 instances, control in/out traffic at instance level
=== Network Access Control Lists - Firewall for the subnets, control in/out traffic at subnet level ===

== Cloudformation ==
Create template on JSON or YAML
Save on S3
Use CF to call the bucket and create stack
CF reads the file, understands services involved, the order, relationship between services...then provisions services one by one
=== Elements of Cloudformation template ===
Template parameters
Output values
Data tables
Resources
File format version

== Upgrade or downgrade a System with Zero Downtime ==
Open EC2 Console
Choose OS AMI
Launch instance with the new instance type
Install updates
Install applications
Test the instance
Move DNS to it

Identifies suspitious activities through Cloudtrail Insights and EventBridge (TODO: Eventbridge)

== Elasticache ==
In-memory caching service that acts as a data store. Useful to accelerate performance (access in microseconds)
It can be used as cache, but also DB, messabe broker and queue

== Lambda ==
Serverless/event-driven computing service
Allows running code without provisioning or managing servers
It also has scaling capabilities

== ECS ==
AKA ECR or Amazon Elastic Container Registry
Compresses and Encrypts images, and controls access to them

== EFS ==
Serverless, Elastic File System
Allows adding or removing files on the filesystem without provisioning and management
It creates File systems using EC2 launch instance wizard, EFS console, CLI and API

== Aurora ==
MySQL and PostgreSQL relational DB
Fully mananged by AWS, automates provisioning, setup, backups and patching

== RDS ==
Relational Database Service that allows setup, operation and scaling of Relational DBs in the Cloud
Automates administrative tasks such as provisioning, DB setup and backups (TODO: differences RDS and Aurora)
Offers familiar Engines such as Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle DB and SQL server.
=== Provisioned IOPS vs. Standard RDS ===
Use Provisioned IOPS when you have batch-oriented workloads (no manual intervention)
Provisioned IOPS delivers high IO rates, but expensive

== Route 53 ==
Highly scalable Cloud Domain Name System (DNS)
It connects with AWS infrastructure such as EC2, ELB and S3 buckets
It allows for DNS health checks to monitor applications continuously for their abilitz to recover from failures (TODO: check that)
=== Difference between Domain and Hosted Zone ===
Domain is a collection of data describing self-contained administrative and technical unit (TODO: ???)
Hosted Zone is a container holding information about how to route traffic on the internet for a specific domain
=== How does Route53 provide  HA and low latency ===

AWS Cloudfront
VPC
(TODO: what are Shield and WAF?)

== A service is not available in a particular region... ==
Not all AWS services are available in all regions from day 0. It normally starts on some regions and gets implemented gradually on the rest.
The only solution left is to switch to the nearest Region providing that service.

A buffer helps integrate and synchronize various components in AWS and helps maintain equilibrium by linking multiple apparatus to deliver quick services at uniform rate

== Types of volumes in EBS ==
General purpose
Magnetic
Provisioned IOPS
Cold HDD
Throughput optimized
=== Difference between EBS and instance store ===
EBS is permanent storage in which the data can be restored later
Instance Store is temporary storage that is physically attached to a host machine

== How to auto-delete old snapshots ==
Take snapshots of the EBS on S3
Use AWS Ops automator to handle snapshots automatically

== EC2 ==
=== Security Best practices EC2 ===
Only allowing trusted hosts or networks to access ports on an instance
Only opening up permissions required and disable password login for instances launched from your AMI
Using IAM to control access to AWS resources
=== Pricing Model for EC2 ===
On-Demand
Reserved
Spot
Dedicated Hosts
=== Difference between stopping and terminating an instance ===
Stop -> Normal shutdown on instance and moved to stopp state
Terminate -> Same but EBS volumes attached to it are deleted and cannot be recovered
=== Difference between Instance and AMI ===
AMI is template consisting of Software configuration
=== What is T2 instance ===
Allow to burst to higher performance when workload demands it with a moderate baseline performance
These are General purpose and low in cost

== RDS vs. DynamoDB vs. Redshift ==
RDS is a DB manager for relational DBs
DynamoBD is NoSQL DB for unstructured data
Redshift is DWH for data analysis

== Benefits of AWS's disaster recovery ==
It avoids the cost of having a second physical site
It ranges from DR for small customer workload to Failover at scale

== To transfer huge amounts of data, which Snow- option is best? == 
Snowball is a data transport solution to move big amounts of data in-out of an AWS region
Snowball Edge adds computing functions on top of the Data Transport solution
Snowmobile is an Exabyte-scale migration service that allows to transfer data up to 100PB

== Advantages of IAM ==
Allows administrator to provide multiple users and groups with granular access
It further gives federated access, which allows to grant applications and users access to resources without having to create IAM roles
=== Policies for users' passwords ===
minimum length, have at least one special character
Requirements for Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, non-alphanumeric
Automatic Pass expiration, prevent reuse, request for pass reset on next sign in
Have users contact account admin when their password was allowed to expire
=== IAM role vs IAM user ===
IAM role is an entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests, while IAM user is permanent long-term credentials used to interact with AWS services directly
In the IAM role trusted entities, like IAM users, apps or an AWS service, assume roles whereas the IAM user has direct access

== Cloudformation vs. Elastic Beanstalk ==
Cloud formation Helps provision and describe infrastructure resources. It supports  the infrastructure needs for applications, legacy and existing

== How to use AWS WAF to monitor apps ==
AWS WAF protects from web exploitations
It helps control traffic flow to apps
On WAF you can also create custom rules to block common attack patterns
Allow all requests/Prevent all requests/Count all requests
Beanstalk provides an environment that makes it easy to deploy and run apps in the cloud. It is combined with Dev tools to help manage lifecycle of apps.
